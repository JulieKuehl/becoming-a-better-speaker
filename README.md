## Workshop

You can use the bathroom at any time, and get up and move around whenever you want to.

### Introduce Facilitator(s)

Facilitators say a few words about themselves.

### Go Through Agenda

The agenda that we are going to cover today is:

*   Introductions
*   [Why are we holding a workshop for]
*   What We Are Looking For
*   Dispelling The Myths of Speakers
*   Why Do You Want To Speak?
*   Talk Formats
*   Becoming a Better Speaker Dos and Don'ts
*   Practice giving a short talk

_(Choose the short or long version of introductions, depending on how much time you have.)_

### Introductions [Short Version]

Let's all introduce ourselves. Going around the circle, each person say:

*   Your name
*   Your preferred pronoun
*   Your WordPress experience
*   What is your speaking experience, if any?
*   What you want out of the workshop

### Introductions [Long Version — Interview Neighbor ice breaker game]

Let's all introduce ourselves. You have 3 minutes. _(Instructor may need to vary the time based on workshop attendance and time available)_ Ask your neighbor to answer one of these questions. Then we will go around the room and each person will have 1 minute to introduce their neighbor with their answer.

*   What got you into WordPress?
*   What country would you most like to travel to?
*   If a movie of your life was made, which actor would you want to play you?
*   If you could have dinner with any person, living or dead, who would it be?
*   What is your favorite way to waste time at work, without getting caught?
*   What is the most life altering experience you’ve had in the last five years?
*   What is one fun thing you did this week?

Now you have one minute to introduce your neighbor to the rest of the group. _(Instructor might want to hold up a tablet with a count-down timer)_

### [ Why are we holding a workshop for <specific group>

There are a few reasons that we want to hold this workshop for <specific group> today:

1.  A disproportionately large number of the speakers at WordPress meetups and WordCamps (and tech events in general) are white men.  That means that the speakers do not represent everyone sitting in the audience. <Specific group> may, therefore feel like they don't belong there. But there are many <specific group> with a wide range of knowledge to share and everyone can feel included.
2.  WordPress is amazing in that it is open source and so all sorts of people use it. We want a more fair representation of the users in the people who are speaking.
3.  One of the ways in which WordPress is being shaped is by the people who speak about it publicly. Many <specific group>, by nature of having had different life experiences, would approach problems differently. Just as how a developer's point of view is different from a user's point of view, so are our viewpoints vs the standard speaker. <Specific group> have experiences that aren't necessarily being shared right now.
4.  By bringing in more diverse people, there's a better chance of bringing in folks who are straddling several roles and thus creating unique things with unique perspectives. Power users who use it in interesting ways, front-end developers, business people who use plugins to make specific kinds of sites, typographers who use WordPress to do crazy things with typography.... People to talk about running a business in WordPress, how developers can communicate with designers, different things you can do with WordPress...... etc. ]

### What We Are Looking For

*   If you are giving this workshop to recruit speakers for a particular WordCamp or meetup, this is a good time to explain what you are looking for if you need speakers to speak on particular subjects or to particular audiences.

### Dispelling The Myths (What We Think A Speaker Is vs What They Actually Are)

Everyone has their own reasons for not speaking in public, especially at tech events, but most of those reasons are based on myths that we can dispel or concerns that we can address:

1.  **Myth 1: I’m not an expert!**  That’s okay, you don’t have to be an expert!  Everyone has a different idea of what “expert” means.  No one knows everything, and everyone has something to learn.  You just need to know more about your topic than your audience knows.  You can find a topic where you have knowledge that your audience does not.  There are things you do with WordPress all the time that other people do not do with WordPress all the time – that makes you an expert in their eyes. Even if your audience has knowledge about the same topic, they will not frame that knowledge the same way – they will still have something to learn from you. There is a saying, "In the land of the blind, the one-eyed person is king" [or queen]. As long as you know a little bit more than many of the people in your audience, that's all you need. You are probably more of an expert than you think you are.  A lot of us suffer from Imposter Syndrome.  This psychological phenomenon where you feel like you are an imposter, you think you don’t really have the knowledge or skills to be here, but you have managed to fool everyone and soon they’ll find out.  Imposter syndrome is really common – you aren’t alone.[A lot of us have imposter syndrome because we don't see people like us presented as experts.Many people in <our specific group> set a much higher bar for “expert” knowledge than <not specific group> do.]Many communities have surveyed their members to ask what kind of information they want to learn at meetups and WordCamps, and most people request beginner topics. Remember that there are people out there who know nothing about any of this stuff, and they want to know more!  If you have used WordPress before, you have knowledge that other people want you to share. One area where you are always an expert is your own experience. Case studies make great talks – talk about how you did something, how you learned something, how you overcame an obstacle, the process you went through to create something or to solve a problem.  These kinds of talks are great because they are unique – not just the same information that anyone can find in an online tutorial.  These topics help everyone overcome the “I’m not an expert” problem – you’re a normal person sharing a normal experience, and that’s valuable, so people will come to value their own experience and expertise. So you might not feel like an expert, but you are!  If you care about your topic, that will shine through and that’s what’s important.
2.  **Myth 2: People will ask questions I can’t answer, and I’ll look like a fool.**  Yes, people very well might ask questions you can’t answer, but that’s okay! Your audience understands that not everyone knows everything, and it can be hard to think on your feet – the audience is sympathetic. If you don’t know the answer, there are several things you can do:
    *   You can ask if anyone in the audience has the answer.
    *   You can tell them you will look up the answer and get back to them.  Tell them you’ll post the answer on your blog – then you get more visitors to your website!
    *   Sometimes people ask questions that are off topic – feel free to tell them their question is off-topic and you would be happy to discuss it with them later.
    *   Also, remember that it’s okay to say, “I don’t know” – people will think more highly of you if you admit you don’t know than if you try to make up an answer.
3.  **Myth 3: I’m too nervous to speak!**  Your audience gets that too – after all, most of them didn’t have the bravery to speak.  First of all, practice practice practice!  The more you practice - in front of pets, family, friends, the mirror, small audiences - the less nervous you will be.  But if you are still nervous, that’s okay!  Everyone gets nervous in front of audiences, and that’s just a part of being human. Keep in mind that your audience is on your side – they want to see you succeed.  In fact, it’s okay to admit that you are nervous – people will be sympathetic.  I’m nervous right now, too, but I’m up here speaking in front of you and I haven’t died yet!  Making a little joke at the beginning about being nervous (like I just did) will dispel the nervous energy in the room. If you’re really nervous, don’t start by speaking at an event where you will have a big audience.  Start at a smaller meetup.
4.  **Myth 4: I have failed if everyone in the audience isn’t totally engaged**.  Sometimes when you’re speaking, you will look out at the audience and it will look like everyone is bored.  That’s okay.  First of all, most of them probably aren’t as bored as they look.  Audiences generally sit with neutral faces, so if they aren’t smiling and nodding and cheering, that doesn’t mean they aren’t engaged.  If they are using their phone/tablet/laptop/another device, that doesn’t mean they’re ignoring you - in fact, it might mean they are writing down your every word.  And no matter how good a speaker you are, you will not connect with everyone in the audience.  That’s okay - no speaker can connect with everyone.  Expect that, don’t take it personally, and be happy with the people who do connect with you.
5.  **Myth 5: A talk followed by a Q&A is the only format I can use to share my knowledge.**  No, there are plenty of other ways to share your expertise at WordPress events.  You could lead a group discussion, or lead a workshop, or put together a panel discussion.  Some events offer the opportunity for lightning talks - this is a great format if you’re nervous because it’s okay to talk fast and it’s over quickly.

**(optional) Questions for the group:** What do you think? What are things you're worried about?  Why haven’t you talked at a meetup or WordCamp? If you've only talked once, why did you not do it again?

### Why Do You Want To Speak?

A question for you: Why do you want to speak? After people have given their reasons (or if no one gives reasons), read off this list:

1.  Be seen as an authority in your field
2.  Share your knowledge with others
3.  Build your confidence - it scares me
4.  Give back to the community
5.  Meet people - be part of the community
6.  Travel
7.  Learn at conferences - speaking teaches you more
8.  It’s fun!
9.  Rewarding, feeling of accomplishment
10.  Career building
11.  Be a role model for <my specific group>

### Talk Formats

Now that we've talked about why we are holding this workshop for <specific group> [or: what kind of things we're looking for], myths about what it takes to be a speaker, and why you want to speak, let's start talking about the actual talks. A lot of talks are big "how to" brain dump sessions. "How to make a plugin" might be someone walking through how to make it, maybe even live coding, and then at the end, there are questions. WordCamp Central has found that this isn't necessarily a good way to impart information. People often walk away feeling overwhelmed and not remembering anything that they learned. There are other talk formats that promote story-based learning. Talking about how you learned something, for example, means other people can also learn how to learn. As well, different talk formats involving more people becomes more engaging. Here are some of the various formats:

*   **How To:** The standard way that tech talks happen
*   **Discussion:** You are the facilitator on a topic and the audience discusses it together
*   **Panel:** Multiple people answer questions on the same topic
*   **Story-based:** This could be how you learned something, mistakes you made, or any other narrative format
*   **Case Study:** The story of how you created one thing, in particular
*   **Workshop:** A hands-on learning experience where people bring their laptops and create a thing as you go

A talk can also be more than one person. Duo talks are really engaging.  

### Practising Speaking

The most important thing you can do to become a better speaker is to practise!  The more you speak - in front of a mirror, in front of friends, or in front of a room full of people - the more comfortable and the better you will become.  You can even give your talk to a friend over Skype. You can also video record yourself. Take notes on behaviors you exhibit while speaking, then practice reducing them. When you practice, time yourself.  You might be surprised by how long or short your talk is when you are speaking out loud, and it is important to know how long your talk is going to take. If you're looking for opportunities to practice speaking, you might see if there is a Toastmasters in your area. They will provide you with many opportunities to speak in front of a supportive group of people, and give you tips and tools for improvement. You can also practise at smaller meetups. WordPress meetups are good for practising for WordCamps. If you want to practise for WordPress meetups, you could find smaller related meetups who would be interested in hearing about your WordPress topic. If you speak at a WordCamp, most recordings are made available on wordpress.tv and you can watch your video at a later date.  

### Becoming a Better Speaker Do's and Don'ts

No matter how much public speaking experience you have, there is always room for improvement.  Here are some do's and don'ts to help you improve.

#### Do:

*   **Speak slowly.** Many speakers speak too fast, but audiences almost never complain that someone went too slowly. Take pauses in between sentences. It may feel strange to you, but will seem very natural to the audience.
*   **Have water available and drink it.** Most events will provide water for the speaker, but make sure you have water on hand just in case. When you find yourself going too fast, taking a drink of water is a great way to slow yourself down. It might feel like it takes forever to take a drink, but the audience doesn't mind.
*   **Vary your voice.** This gets easier with practice. You don't want to speak in a monotone, so make sure you have some inflection in your tone.
*   **Look at your whole audience.** Make eye contact with people if you can, but make sure you scan the whole room and don't just look at one part of the audience. One trick here is to locate some friendly faces in multiple sections of a big audience, then address them one at a time in a loop.
*   **Make sure the audience can hear you.** If you aren't sure whether the mic or your voice is loud enough, ask the audience if they can hear you. Ask the people in the back to raise their hands if you get too quiet.
*   **Keep your hands above your waist.** If you do this, you will find yourself gesturing naturally.
*   **Remember to breathe.**
*   **Practice without notes.** Even if you'd like to have your notes with you to make you less nervous, practicing your talk without notes helps you map your content to your thought process. You already know your subject matter, so avoid trying to memorize your notes and script verbatim. This will help your talk sound more natural and for you to feel better about deviating from your script.

#### Don't:

*   **Drink too much coffee.** You're already jittery from nerves, so you don't need a coffee buzz on top of it!
*   **Turn away from the audience.** If you need to point something out in your slides, make sure that you keep your face pointed toward the audience as you point.
*   **Use filler words like "um."** You might not even notice you are doing this so ask a friend to point it out in rehearsal or record yourself and take notes.
*   **Read your slides or notes directly.** Make sure you look up from your notes, and ad lib at least a little bit.

### Handling Nerves

Everyone gets nervous about public speaking.  It is a part of being human.  In fact, it's hard-wired: for our cavemen ancestors, any time more than 5 pairs of eyes were looking at them at once, that meant that in all likelihood they were about to die.  We still react that way when we get up in front of a group of people and see them all watching us. Keep in mind that your audience is on your side – they want to see you succeed, and all of them would be nervous if they were in your shoes.  In fact, it’s okay to admit that you are nervous – people will be sympathetic. Here are some things you can do to help soothe your nerves:

*   **Practice!** It really does get easier with practice.  The more you practice the better you will know your material and the more confident you will be.
*   **Sleep.** If you are well-rested, you will do a better job.  Resist the urge to network or socialize too much the night before.
*   **Exercise.** The best way to get rid of nervous energy is to burn it off.  Physiologically, the reason you get nervous is so that you will have the energy and adrenaline to fight or flee from your predator.  Running or getting some other form of exercise is a great way to burn off that nervous energy and convince your body that the danger is over.
*   **Breathe. **When we get nervous, we tend to take shallow breaths into our chest.  This is a part of the body's preparation for fight or flight, and it actually deprives the brain of some of its important oxygen.  Take long slow breaths into your belly, and this will help calm you and clear your mind.
*   **Dress comfortably.** Being body-conscious never helps, so make sure you are comfortable in whatever you are wearing.
*   **Take time for yourself before you speak.** This helps you compose yourself and get mentally prepared.  You could go for a walk, listen to some favorite music, go over your notes, or just take some really deep breaths.
*   **Know the stage.** Try to find a time before you give your talk to see the room where you will be speaking.
*   **Use your own devices.** If you have your own laptop, clicker, or whatever you need, you will be more comfortable with your equipment. If you won't be using your own devices, come early to ensure you're able to get your notes onto the system and that you can use the system with ease.
*   **Adopt a persona.** This doesn't mean don't be yourself, it just means be the Speaker version of yourself.  For instance, if you tend to talk with your hands when you are nervous, embrace that and make it a part of your speaker persona.  You will behave differently when you are in front of a big group of people: go with that and don't fight it.

### Handling Q&A

#### **Timing**

Many talks have an audience questions-and-answer session at the end. Ask the organizers in advance what the expectations are. Try timing your talk when you rehearse it and make sure you've left room for an adequate amount of Q&A time, if that's something you'll be expected to do.

How much time should you allow for Q&A? If the organizers haven't specified this for you, it usually depends on length of your whole session. In general, 10-20 minutes is adequate. For example, if your whole presentation takes up a 45-minute slot you might want to allow 35 minutes for the presentation and 10 minutes for questions.

#### **Interspersing Q&A**

Some people prefer to take questions throughout their talk rather than holding them until the end. Let your audience know up front what you prefer, bearing in mind that if your audience will be using a microphone due to the size of the room or the fact that your talk is being recorded, you'll need to give the room technician a heads-up about your Q&A plans so they're ready with the audience microphone as needed.

#### **Don't Forget to Ask for Questions!**

If you're saving Q&A until the end, don't forget to do it once you finish your talk! To remind yourself, you can add a slide at the end of your talk saying thanks and asking for questions.

<div class="postcontent">

#### **Repeat the Question Back to the Audience**

Unless the audience is mic'ed, repeat each question before answering. Your audience and anyone later watching the video (if your talk is being recorded) will thank you. **Tricky Questions** Often speakers who are brand new to public speaking, and even ones that aren't, are nervous about getting asked a question that they feel they don't know the answer to or that has a tricky answer. There are a few ways to handle that situation:

*   Remember to repeat the question back to the audience.  This buys you a little bit of time to think about how to handle the question.
*   Don't be afraid to admit that you don't know.  The audience will have far more respect for you for admitting than you don't know than if you try to fudge it and fail.
*   You can say something like: "That's a good question. I'm not sure about the answer, but let me look into that for you – could you send me a tweet or email after the session and we'll stay in touch?"
*   You can throw it to the audience with something like: "Good question! I'm actually not sure, does anyone here have any ideas?"
*   Throw the question to a friend or colleague in the audience: "Good question! My colleague Jane actually knows a lot about that – hey Jane, do you have any ideas on this one?" You can also talk to your colleagues/friends beforehand and make sure they're OK with being put on the spot like this.

#### **The Smarty-Pants**

Handling the “smarty-pants” in the audience who thinks they know better than you and goes on and on and on is a big fear. It doesn't happen often, but if it does, one thing to keep in mind is that in these sorts of situations, other people in the audience are thinking about how much of an idiot the know-it-all  is, not about how you’re handling it. Don't be afraid to cut someone off if they're monopolizing the Q&A or derailing it. It's possible to do this politely but firmly: "I think we're going to have to move on now because time is running out and I really want to get a few more questions in."

#### **Unrelated Questions**

Sometimes people will ask questions that have little or nothing to do with your talk and answering the question will derail the conversation. One way of handling this is to say, "That's a good question, but it's outside of the scope of what we're talking about. I'd be happy to answer it for you privately after."

#### **Silence**

What if you finish your talk, throw open the floor to the audience and there are no questions? That's totally OK! There aren't always questions.

*   You can have one or two people you know in the audience ready to ask a question, or even chime in with a different angle. For example, if you’re a developer, have a designer ready with an observation on your topic from that point of view.
*   You can also ask and answer your own questions. For example: "Something I didn't go into in depth in the talk, but that you might be wondering about, is…" or "A question I've had come up before is..."
*   You can ask the audience a question. For example: "Something I didn't go into in depth in the talk, but that you might be wondering about, is...” or “A question I’ve had come up before is….”

#### **Errors**

Don't be afraid to correct errors after your talk. If someone points out an error – either during the Q&A or later – go ahead and update your presentation online and include the correction if you give the same talk again. Be sure to verify that the "correction" is actually accurate before doing this!

#### **Contact & Slides**

Once the Q&A is over, let people know how to connect with you once you're done and where to find your slides. Give out your Twitter handle and/or email, whatever avenues you're comfortable with. You can also include this information on your final slide so that it's up on the screen behind you while you take questions.

### Getting post-talk feedback

We often forget this part of the process, but getting feedback after your talk is really important if you ever want to get better at public speaking. You want to get feedback about both your content and your speaking style. You want feedback about whether your content was interesting, well organized, easy to follow, etc. This is true whether you plan to ever give this same talk again or not because a lot of the knowledge gained can be generalized.  You also want to know about your speaking technique: How was the pace, volume, approachability, etc. Where can you get feedback?  Ask conference organizers if they send out a survey, and whether you can see your own feedback. Ask people you know who were there for feedback. The more specific your questions the better the feedback you will get. (Don’t ask “What did you think,” ask “Was there something you thought could have been better? Could you hear me? Did I speak too quickly or too slowly?" etc). Keep in mind that asking people for feedback directly will be different from asking organizers for the feedback that was sent to them. People tend to be softer and kinder when speaking to you, as opposed to when they think that their feedback is only going to organizers.

### Practice Giving A Short Talk

_(If they are not already, students should be arranged theater-style, with the speaker standing at the front of the room and everyone's chairs facing the speaker.)_ Since practice is the most important thing you can do to become a better speaker, we're going to take this opportunity to practice. I am going to give you a list of questions.  Choose one of these questions, and write down a few things you can say to answer the question.  Then come to the front of the room and talk about it for 2 minutes. _(If you have time, students can talk for longer.)_ For this exercise, content doesn't matter.  We will not be critiquing anything you say.  You don't have to say anything interesting. This is just to give you a chance to practice.  You may request receiving feedback if you wish. The group will give you some positive feedback and constructive criticism. List of questions:

*   What did you do last weekend?
*   What is your favorite app?  Why do you like it?
*   Tell the story of the first time you used WordPress.
*   Describe a walk through your favorite park or museum.

Before each one starts:

*   Ask them if they would like us to record them on their phones so they can watch it later.
*   Ask them if they wish for feedback.
*   They may watch their time on the large device (such as iPad).

(Each student will get up and talk.  Time them and make them stop when the time is up.  If they wanted feedback, turn to the room and ask:

*   "What are three things this person did well?"
*   When you have three things, ask "What are three things this person could have done better?"

Try to make sure that the feedback is offered as helpful constructive critique, not as harsh criticism - you can do this by offering the first critique.)  </div>
